        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>As a lean customer-driven startup, we rapidly adding features our users need and want for their work. This adds a lot of complexity to our app, which can cause us initially add features in ways that are suboptimal for our user. Our users tend of medical professionals or small business owners who are not necessarily tech savvy. It’s very important to us that we provide a learnable and enjoyable user experience while ensuring security for our customers files. We were due to rethink how the various features on our app come together. We decided to begin from the People page. A cornerstone of our product is the ease with which users can share folders while still remaining secure, and these permissions are managed through the People page. This is the most important part of our app in many ways, because it is the primary way to manage permissions, sharing and teams on Sookasa. We used a user centered approach in which I conducted user research, created prototypes, and worked with known customer needs and feedback.</p>


        <h3>Investigating the problem</h3>
        <p>We needed to design a solution that would work well for team admin who have to manage large groups of people and that the decisions made their would affect the entire app.</p>

        <p>Through customer feedback and our own observation, we knew that the existing design of the people list was poorly organized and difficult to navigate. For example, on our app it is possible to have team members, as well as external partners. While it is very important for team admin to be able to tell these two groups apart, they were mixed together and not clearly identified. (could give more examples) I also researched into common patterns for various UI elements, so that we could make sure that our UI would be learnable.</p>
        <h3>Rapid prototyping and user testing</h3>

        <p>I began by brainstorming and prototyping different ways to display the information. People could be broken down into current team members, pending team members (who have not set up accounts or accepted the invite), external collaborators, called partners, and pending partners. I played with how to display these different groups, as well as the actions and information that needed to be performed. Also worked with how to add people or remind groups of team members to join. I used sketch and marvel to create digital prototypes. I also used paper, pen, and scissors to create paper prototypes. Paper prototypes allowed for faster iteration because they are faster to create, and I could respond and adapt to feedback on the fly. (photos)</p>
        <p>I tested prototypes with about 20 people over the week, including people in coffee shops, colleagues, and existing customers. Tested by giving them common tasks in the interface, and asking lots of questions. This gave direction to new iterations and prototypes and identified other parts of the page that were confusing to users. By the end of the week, had a prototype that was easily understood by all five testers from that day, and appeared to solve many problems. As designer, I’m immersed in the product and the work I create. feedback from outsiders essential to the process of creating an intuitive learnable app design</p>


        <h3>Wireframes and specification</h3>
        <p>Organizing the list into two tiers of tabs was easily understood. Even though it had taken many versions to create, the layout finally felt obvious to people. We kept the development team updated along the process, and discussed with them ideas for what we planned and how to implement them .After finalizing the design and creating annotated wireframes explaining the layout and function of the new people tab, we met again to discuss the implementation of the design. Some aspects we would tackle in the next sprint, some such as people search, would be added as improvements later on.</p>

        <h3>Visual design</h3>
        <p>We sent finalized wireframe to our visual designer. He created several iterations of a new look and feel for our app that would be in line with our brand identity. Taking his beautiful mockups, I used this as a basis for the styling. We’ve tweaked and iterated on the original design to play nicely with other areas of our app. I created interpretations for other areas of the app and interactions and asked him for feedback.</p>

    <h3> Implementation process</h3>

    <p>Our wonderful developers did heavy lifting change the logic and restructure the code to change the functionality.</p>

    <p>I worked with the existing html pages to change style and layout. Write css</p>
    <p>I created a custom version of bootstrap, so we could quickly give the app some new skin - quickly change colors and fonts, with fewer overrides and fewer lines of css. I also had to do a lot of detailed work in the css, including cleaning up redundant classes and classes that override the new bootstrap template.</p>


    <p>Throughout the process, I’ve been doing my best to make sure developers have the information they need to implement and write issues specifying changes to the app so it can be referred back to. Working closely with developers has allowed us to tacked edge cases and technical constraints that weren’t covered in the original specifications. If a certain feature takes a lot of backend work (such as display blocked devices), we work together to find the best solution we can now, and keep it as an improvement for the future.</p>
